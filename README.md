I steps are taken to complete this project:

1. Finding a free public APi: There I have used several public APIs from Meal DB and Cocktail DB

Links are provided bellow:

Meal DB : https://www.themealdb.com/
Cocktail DB : https://www.thecocktaildb.com/

2. CodeBase :I have used the Next Js for building this application.
3. CSS Framework : I have used Tailwind css framework for styling purpose.
4. Component Library : Daisy UI and Material Ui are used as Pluged IN
5. State Management : Redux Toolkit and React Redux has been used to create a global state of this project.
6. Icons : Material Icons has been used for eye-catchy UI.
7. API Fetching : I have used TanStack query to feth APIs

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
